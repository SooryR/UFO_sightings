# UFO Sightings Report Analysis

This report summarizes the analysis of UFO sighting data, focusing on the distribution of reported shapes across different states and time periods. The analysis is based solely on visual observations from a hypothetical bubble plot visualization, and some conclusions may be speculative.

## Analysis by State

### Early States (ab to de):

*   **Low Overall Frequency:** These states generally exhibit lower frequencies of UFO sightings across all reported shapes. The bubble sizes are smaller, indicating fewer reports compared to later states.
*   **Dominance of Common Shapes:** The shapes like "circle," "sphere," and "oval" tend to be the most reported, even in these states with fewer reports.
*   **Sparse Reporting of Other Shapes:** Shapes other than the aforementioned common ones are very sparsely reported or even absent.

### Middle States (dc to mo):

*   **Increased Reporting:** There is a noticeable increase in the overall frequency of sightings in this cluster of states. The bubbles are generally larger compared to the first group of states.
*   **"Circle", "Sphere", and "Oval" Dominance Continues:** While there's an increase in overall reports, the "circle," "sphere," and "oval" shapes remain prominent in these states.
*   **Appearance of "Triangle":** The "triangle" shape becomes more consistently visible in this part of the series, suggesting either an increase in the reported frequency of this shape or a change in the population reporting the shape.
*   **Emergence of "Other" Reports:** "Other" appears with more regularity and volume in this cluster of states, hinting that it may not be uniform in its distribution.

### Later States (ms to yk):

*   **Higher Overall Reporting Frequency:** The states in this section show the most frequent reports overall, with the largest bubble sizes being observed here.
*   **"Light", "Flash", and "Cylinder" Concentrations:** There is a concentration of "light," "flash", and "cylinder" sightings in the later parts of this group of states, specifically, the larger bubbles appear to be associated with the shapes towards the bottom of the y-axis.
*   **Variability in Shapes:** While circle, sphere and oval are still prevalent, some of the earlier shapes begin to fall off and more unknown shapes appear to occur.
*   **"Unknown" and "Changing" Concentration:** There is a noticeable increase in the frequency and report size of the "unknown" and "changing" shapes. This suggests that more of these "unclassifiable" events were reported in this portion of the series than anywhere else.

### Specific State Trends:

*   **Individual State Anomalies:** Some states may display more anomalous patterns such as high numbers of "fireball" sightings relative to others or greater bubble sizes than the average for a shape, but this is difficult to quantify beyond a qualitative estimation.
*   **Clustering and Similarity:** Certain states within the same regions might exhibit similar reporting patterns, although this is not a strong effect visually.
*   **"Unknown" State:** The "unknown" state exhibits some reported occurrences of a few common shapes, but also many reports with non-uniform sizes. It is hard to draw further conclusions.

### General Trends

Based on the overall pattern in the data, the following general trends are apparent:

#### Dominance of Basic Geometric Shapes:
*   **Consistent Presence:** "Circle," "sphere," and "oval" are consistently reported across all states. Their bubbles are the most frequently observed.
*   **Possible Explanations:**
    *   **Cognitive Bias:** People may tend to describe unfamiliar objects using familiar, simple geometric shapes.
    *   **Perceptual Bias:** These may also reflect how objects are perceived, and what the human eye registers.
    *   **Reporting Simplification:** In written reports, these general shapes may be used when a more detailed shape cannot be adequately described by text.

#### Non-Uniform Shape Distribution:
*   **Shape Groups:** Shapes that are visually similar or that have similar connotations to reporting might appear in clusters.
*   **Lower Frequency of Less Common Shapes:** Shapes such as "cone," "cross," "chevron," "fireball," "rectangle," "cigar," "diamond," and "teardrop" are less frequently reported overall.
*   **Potential Reporting Factors:** These could be the actual less common shapes reported, or they might be more accurately described by the common shapes that are often reported.

#### Regional Variations:
*   **State Patterns:** There are differences in the relative proportions of shapes and the overall number of reports in different states, suggesting that geographic factors are likely a factor.
*   **Reporting Influences:** It is difficult to ascertain the specific reasons for these differences without further context.

#### Increasing Report Volume:
*   **Later States:** The later states and the states in the center of the x-axis tend to have larger bubbles, indicative of a higher report volume than the earlier ones.
*   **Reporting Time or Method:** A higher volume of reports can be attributed to many reasons including the way the data was collected over time.

### Possible Interpretations

It is essential to emphasize that these interpretations are speculative based solely on the image data:

#### Reporting Bias and Human Perception:

*   **Familiar Categories:** The predominance of "circle," "sphere," and "oval" shapes may be a result of how people categorize unfamiliar objects into familiar categories.
*   **Cognitive Economy:** The human brain may default to the simplest shape categories.
*   **Limited Vocabulary:** Lack of a comprehensive vocabulary to describe complex or unique shapes could drive the use of simpler descriptions.

#### Potential for Real Shape Variations:

*   **Geographic Factors:** There are different reporting volumes and types of sightings between different states. These might represent that sightings occur in one place at a greater volume than others.
*   **Shape Diversity:** The variation in reported shapes suggests that sightings may not only be basic geometric shapes.
*   **Unexplained Phenomena:** The presence of "other", "unknown", "changing" shapes could indicate potentially complex and unclassifiable phenomena that challenge pre-established categories.

#### Temporal and Technological Factors:

*   **Reporting Changes Over Time:** The trends show an overall increase in reporting volume across the later states. This could represent an increase in sightings or an increased reporting rate.
*   **Technological Influence:** The rise in sightings of shapes such as "light", "flash", and "cylinder", may be due to the advances in aerospace technology.

#### Data Limitations:

*   **Inherent Bias:** The data is likely subject to various reporting biases that cannot be accounted for, such as the likelihood of someone reporting a sighting, or the likelihood that a specific sighting gets properly recorded.
*   **Data Collection Methods:** The way the data was collected may bias the results.
*   **No Root Causes:** It's crucial to recognize that the data alone cannot provide any insight into the true nature or root causes of the reported sightings.

### General Expected Relationship:

*   **Higher Population, More Reports (Generally):** Typically, one would expect that states with larger populations would have a higher number of reported sightings, simply because there are more people to witness and report such events.

### Observations from the Bubble Plot in Context of Population:

*   **Early States (ab to de):** These states show a low overall volume of reports. These states are generally less populated compared to states in the middle of the x-axis. This observation is consistent with the general expectation that less populated states have fewer reports.
*   **Middle States (dc to mo):** This section exhibits the highest overall volume of reporting in the series. This observation is not entirely consistent with the expected population effects. Although states in this grouping vary in population from low to high, it would be reasonable to assume that most of these states are more populated, and would therefore exhibit higher reporting volumes.
*   **Later States (ms to yk):** The states in this section show an increase in total number of sightings and volume. This result is slightly surprising because based on general US state knowledge, we might expect that the population would be lower. While some of these later states do exhibit higher populations, this would not apply for the whole section.

### Inconsistencies:
*   Some states, despite having similar presumed population levels, might show noticeable variations in report volumes, suggesting that population is not the sole determinant in the number of sightings reported.

### Potential Factors Influencing Deviations:

*   **Reporting Culture:** States with a higher interest in UFO phenomena may have a higher rate of reporting per capita than states where this is less of an issue. This is something that can not be evaluated by the image, but must be considered.
*   **Access to Reporting Mechanisms:** The ease of access to reporting mechanisms can influence the amount of reports received. States with more sophisticated infrastructure, or simply a culture of reporting events might have a higher incidence of UFO reports.
*   **Data Collection Bias:** The data collection method might not be uniform across all states and could introduce bias which is unrelated to population size.
*   **Rural vs. Urban Populations:** Rural populations with less light pollution might have a higher capacity for observing unusual objects, even if their population count is lower. Urban populations, though larger, might have a higher rate of atmospheric interference to make sightings.
*   **Socio-economic and Cultural Background:** It might be that certain demographics are more likely to report sightings than others, although this can not be evaluated from the image.
*    **Psychological Factors:** Individual psychology and the general likelihood of a group of individuals to interpret unusual sightings differently can be a strong factor in the results, but this is something that is not evident in the image and therefore not something we can assess.

## Analysis by Time Period

### Observations by Shape and Time Period

#### Early Period (1910 - 1940):

*   **Extremely Low Reporting:** The reported frequencies for all shapes are near zero during this early period. There is no substantial reporting during this period.

#### Mid-Century Period (1940 - 1980):

*   **Slight Increase in Reporting:** There's a slight increase in reported frequencies for certain shapes, though the values are still small compared to later years.
*   **Shape Diversity:** A wider variety of shapes begins to appear, including "disk," "triangle," "light," "rectangle," "sphere," "circle," "flash," "chevron," and "cone", though the overall volume of reporting is still low.
*   **"Disk" as Notable Shape:** The "disk" shape appears to have a slightly higher frequency compared to other shapes during this period.

#### Late 20th Century (1980 - 2000):

*   **Noticeable Increase:** There is a noticeable increase in the reporting volume for nearly all shapes in this period.
*   **Consistent Reporting:** The frequencies of various shapes rise steadily over time, suggesting an increasing trend in UFO reporting.
*   **"Light" Shape Emerges:** The "light" shape shows a significant increase, overtaking "disk" in the latter part of this period.
*   **Shape Diversity Continues:** All the shape types in the legend appear in this period, though in different volumes.

#### Early 21st Century (2000 - 2020):

*   **Dramatic Increase:** There is a dramatic increase in the reporting frequency of almost all UFO shapes.
*   **"Light" Shape Dominance:** The "light" shape displays the highest frequency of reports by a large margin, peaking around 2015 and then decreasing rapidly.
*   **High Reporting for Many Shapes:** Many other shapes such as "circle", "sphere", "triangle", "oval", "disk", and "other" show high volumes of reporting, but significantly less than "light".
*   **Peak and Decline:** Most shapes demonstrate a sharp increase to a peak, and a subsequent, rapid decline.

### General Trends

#### Exponential Increase in Reporting:

*   **Low Start, High End:** The reporting frequencies of most shapes start extremely low and show an exponential growth over time.
*   **Late 20th Century Onward:** The bulk of the reports occur in the late 20th and early 21st centuries.

#### Dominance of Certain Shapes:
*   **"Light" Shape Prevalence:** The "light" shape has the most significant and sustained increase in reporting.
*   **"Circle," "Sphere," "Oval," and "Triangle":** Other basic shapes like "circle," "sphere," "oval," and "triangle" are the next most frequently reported after "light."
*   **Other Shapes:** All other shape types do not appear with such high reporting volumes, with "pyramid", "hexagon", and "flare" showing the smallest overall values.

#### Temporal Clustering of Reporting:
*   **Post-1980 Shift:** There is a clear shift in the reporting pattern around the 1980s with a sharp increase in all shapes.

### Possible Interpretations (Based Solely on Visual Analysis)

#### Reporting Bias and Popular Culture:

*   **Increased Awareness:** The exponential increase in reporting may be due to increased public awareness, media attention, or social acceptance of the UFO phenomenon.
*   **Shape Popularity:** The reporting frequency of "light" could be related to changes in the way aerial objects are described. This is something we can evaluate on the chart.
*   **Reporting Systems:** Changes in technology, online reporting systems, and the ease of sharing information about UFO sightings could contribute to the increase.

#### Potential for Real Phenomenal Increase:

*   **Actual Increase in Sightings:** It is possible that the increased reporting reflects a genuine increase in the frequency of unidentified aerial phenomena.
*   **Technological Change:** The rise of shapes like "light" and "flash" could coincide with increased military aviation and technology advancements.
*   **Unknown Causes:** The data cannot confirm root causes or real explanations for the reported sightings.

#### Data Limitations and Possible Biases:

*   **Data Consistency:** It's impossible to know if the data has been collected uniformly across all years.
*   **Reporting Bias:** It is likely that reporting practices have changed over time.
*   **Data Source Bias:** The data source is unknown, and the reliability of such a data set can not be verified.
